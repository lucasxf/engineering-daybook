## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Scope creep | High | High | Strict MVP definition, defer nice-to-haves |
| Time constraints (solo dev) | Medium | High | Focus on 3-5 sessions/week, realistic timeline |
| Learning curve (React/Next.js) | Medium | Medium | Use v0.dev for UI, leverage Claude Code |
| Supabase free tier limits | Low | Low | Monitor usage, upgrade path clear |
| Burnout | High | Medium | Sustainable pace, take breaks, celebrate milestones |

---

## Success Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Success Indicator |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 🏁 MVP Live | Week 8 | App deployed, author using daily |
| 🏷️ Tagging Works | Week 12 | 50+ POKs tagged |

## How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Weekly Check-in:** Review current milestone progress
2. **Adjust as Needed:** Move items between phases based on learnings
3. **Celebrate Wins:** Mark deliverables as done ✅
4. **Update Estimates:** Refine timeline based on actual velocity

This is a living document. Update it as the project evolves.
