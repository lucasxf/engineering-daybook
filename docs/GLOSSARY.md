# Glossary — learnimo

This document defines the terminology used throughout the learnimo project documentation, codebase, and communications.

| **ED** | learnimo — the product/application itself |
| **EDP** | learnimo Project — refers to the overall project (development, documentation, planning) |

## Domain Terms

### POK (Piece of Knowledge)

**Definition:** The atomic/minimal unit of information in learnimo. A single learning entry recorded by the user.

**Synonym:** POL (Piece of Learning) — used interchangeably with POK in internal/developer contexts.

**Usage Guidelines:**

| Context | Use "POK" | Use "learning" |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Code/Technical** | ✅ Types, files, API routes, database tables, tests | ❌ Never in code |
| **User Interface** | ❌ **NEVER** — users won't understand it | ✅ **ALWAYS** — buttons, labels, messages |
| **Documentation** | ✅ Technical specs, ADRs, developer docs | Context-dependent |
| **Translations (i18n)** | ❌ Never | ✅ EN: "learning"<br>PT-BR: "aprendizado" |

**Rationale:** "POK" is internal jargon. "Learning" is semantic and user-friendly, reinforcing that this app is specifically for capturing learnings, not generic notes or todos.

**Examples:**
- Code: `interface Pok`, `pokApi.create()`, `poks` table ✅
- UI: "Save Learning", "My Learnings", "Delete learning?" ✅
- UI: "Create POK", "My POKs" ❌ WRONG

**See also:** `CLAUDE.md` Domain Model section for enforcement rules.

### Learner

**Definition:** A registered user of learnimo. Preferred over "user" in all user-facing contexts to reinforce that learnimo is a tool for people actively engaged in learning.

**Usage Guidelines:**

| Context | Use "Learner" | Use "User" |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **User Interface** | ✅ **ALWAYS** — profile labels, social copy, onboarding | ❌ Avoid in user-facing text |
| **Code/Technical** | Context-dependent — `User` entity/type for infrastructure; `learner` for domain language | ✅ Entity classes, DB tables (`users`), auth code |
| **Documentation** | ✅ Product docs, feature specs | ✅ Technical specs, ADRs |

**Examples:**
- UI: "Follow this learner", "Learner profile", "Connect with learners" ✅
- Code: `class User`, `userRepository`, `userId` ✅
- UI: "Follow this user" ❌ (too generic)

### Other Domain Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Tag** | A categorization label attached to a POK (e.g., `#java`, `#concurrency`, `#system-design`). Can be auto-generated by AI, suggested based on intent, or manually assigned by the learner. |
| **Auto-tagging** | The feature where AI suggests tags for a POK based on its content. Phase 2 covers explicit tags derived directly from the content. Intent-based related-concept suggestions (e.g., a POK about singleton beans also receives `#designpatterns`) ship in Phase 7. Learner approval is required before any tag is saved. |
| **Atomic entry** | A POK that is self-contained and makes sense on its own, without requiring context from other entries. |
| **Colleague** | A mutual follow relationship between two learners (both follow each other). Not a one-sided follow. Emerges automatically — no separate "friend request" flow. |
| **Class / Study Group** | An opt-in group of mutual colleagues. Formed by deliberate decision of the learners involved — never auto-created by the system. May emerge when a set of learners are all colleagues with each other (e.g., A, B, C all mutually follow one another), but grouping into a named class is always the learners' choice. |
| **Share** | The action of re-sharing another learner's public POK — equivalent to a repost. Creates a reference in the sharing learner's feed, attributed to the original author. Rules: (1) only public POKs may be shared; (2) the shared entry's visibility must be equal to or narrower than the original's; (3) if the original author changes the POK to private, all shares of it disappear from feeds and profiles; (4) the original author is always notified when their POK is shared. |
