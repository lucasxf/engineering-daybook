# Initial commit

This will be the setup prompt on project Engineering Daybook.

## Context

I'll be using Claude Web/Desktop project feature paired with Claude Code throughout the entirety of this project. Apart from file "/prompts/Engineering Daybook.md" which was entirely written by myself, most files on this project stemmed from it and were generated with Claude AI assistance following my guidelines.
While there is already a `CLAUDE.md` file, it was generated using Claude Web, not Claude Code, so I'd recommend you go through the entire project and check whether there's need to change that file's current state.

## Directives

- Use plan mode
- think step by step and explain your reasoning
- confirm your understanding of the entire prompt before proceeding
- show your plan to address the goals below and wait for my approval before proceeding
- ask clarifying questions to address any ambiguities you might find

## Goals

For this first session I intend to:

- create the project's missing branches following the git flow and workflow rules defined in the project's documentation
- create the initial commit on this repository
- push that commit to remote
- check if any of the Claude-ai generated files needs fixing
- commit the changes (if any) on the current state of documentation
- migrate the automation workflow from other projects (as described in file `/prompts/Engineering Daybook.md`)
- commit the workflow changes
