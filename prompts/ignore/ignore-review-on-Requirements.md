# Review on Requirements

1. Functional Requirements
   1. Authentication:
      1. add MFA to AUTH requirements on EVOLUTION phase
   2. POKS mgmt
      1. POK-04 make it should have instead of must have for the MVP
      2. POK-06 - make it must have
      3. POK-10 - could have
      4. POK-24 - must have
      5. POK-25 - must have
   3. Data Viz
      1. VIZ-01 must have
      2. VIZ-02 must have
   4. AI
      1. AI-01 - must have
      2. AI-02 - should have
   5. Export: no comments here, it's good. Maybe we'll change it in the future should we add other types of media as POKs
   6. Social
      1. Add sharing to Pubstack like you did on SOC-01 for LinkedIn
2. Non-functional requirements
   1. USE-04 - dark mode - MUST HAVE on MVP
   2. Maybe add a requirement (or a section on the README.md or the most appropriate file) on the naming strategies for git branches. I want the standard flow to be documented, like feature/chore -> develop -> main or something like that
3. 4 assumptions
   1. English AND Portuguese are the primary languages. Both must be supported at day 1 (MVP)
4. MosCow: cool, I did NOT know this acronym (that could be a POK recorded in the ED)

## Conclusion

It looks great! I'm happy with everything else. Just apply the fixes above and move forward.
