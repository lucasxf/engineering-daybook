## Project Vision Review

I loved this, but there are some changes to perform:

- Remove the Chinese proverb. Maybe that should be in this project instructions, but I'm a Brazilian and a black man. Prefer African and Latin American proverbs from now on.
- About **9 - success metrics**:
  - **MVP**
    - 30 consecutive days looks like too much. Sometimes I take a day off to REST or something. I'll most likely use it 3-5 times/week, not 7 days/week (I would love to study that hard, but I'm afraid I won't)
    - We should always avoid perverse incentives and vanity metrics. I want the POKs to grow organically rather than in a competitive manner. So 100+ POKs isn't exactly the best way to measure success. Using the tool and recording learnings is the goal. I don't know what would be the best metric here, but 100 POKs seems a bit too arbitrary
    - I'm happy about the search accuracy metric/goal
  - **Growth**
    - I don't use Twitter/X, remove it. I also don't know exactly how to measure those organic mentions. Will you help me with that? If so, you can keep these metrics

I'm quite happy with everything else.
